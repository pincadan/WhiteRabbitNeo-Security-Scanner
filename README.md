# Here is a penetration testing tool in C++ called "WhiteRabbitNeo Security Scanner":

This penetration testing tool uses the nmap command-line tool to scan the specified target for open ports and vulnerabilities. The tool scans for common ports and vulnerability types using nmap scripts.

To use the tool, you need to have nmap installed on your system. The tool takes the target IP or domain as input, and then scans the target for open ports and vulnerabilities using nmap.

Please note that this is a simplified version of a penetration testing tool and should be used for educational purposes only. Always obtain proper authorization before performing penetration testing on any target.
